# INFLUENTIAL-FACTORS-OF-COGNITIVE-MATURITY-IN-STUDENTS
Objectives
The primary objectives of this study are:

To explore the relationships between innovative and engagement constructs, age, gender, and cognitive maturity.
To investigate the predictive capabilities of innovative and engagement constructs, age, and gender on cognitive maturity.
To assess the significance of these factors in explaining variations in cognitive maturity levels among individuals.
Methodology
The study employs a quantitative cross-sectional design, using structured questionnaires distributed electronically. Data was collected from a diverse sample and analyzed using various statistical methods, including descriptive analysis, inferential analysis (hypothesis testing and regression), and predictive or classification methods (hierarchical agglomerative clustering).

Key Findings
Engagement and innovative constructs are positively correlated with cognitive maturity.
Age shows a significant relationship with cognitive maturity, whereas gender does not.
Regression analysis indicates that engagement and innovative constructs significantly predict cognitive maturity.
Practical Implications
Educators can design strategies to foster engagement and innovative thinking to enhance cognitive maturity.
Organizations can develop training programs to improve critical thinking and problem-solving skills.
Policymakers can use these insights to inform educational and workforce development initiatives.
Conclusion
The study provides valuable insights into the factors influencing cognitive development and highlights the importance of fostering engagement and innovative thinking. Future research could explore longitudinal effects and the impact of other factors such as socio-economic status and cultural background.
